# Session-Key Aspect
## Use Case Summary
**Sesscion-Key Aspect** enables Ethereum on-chain accounts (EoA) to extend their capabilities by creating and managing session keys. These session keys can stand in for the EoA's private key to sign specific transactions and are time-limited, expiring at a block height set by the EoA. They are designed to sign specific transactions, allowing for improved security and usability in various applications.

**With Session-Key Aspect, you can enable following features for your dApp:**
* Enable On-Click-Trading for defi protocol
* Improve UX and wallet security for mini web app (like PWA, bot and TWA in Telegram)
* Use your dApp like web2 products: login once, and click without interacting with the wallet

## Team Members and Roles
Team Member 1: [Mike Ma - Core Dev]

## Problem Addressed
The team aims to address the problem of limited flexibility and security in managing Ethereum accounts. When interacting with the wallet. EoAs often face limitations in terms of transaction signing and managing multiple accounts with various functions. The Session-Key Aspect is designed to provide a solution to these challenges by allowing EoAs to create session keys for specific transactions, improving both security and usability.

For example, in high-frequency trading, each transaction requires interaction with the wallet, and each time, you need to click on the wallet to sign. However, with the session-key, one-click trading becomes possible.


## Project Design

### Session-key Overview

#### 1. EoA binding session key to Aspect

Additional info:

- `Specific contract` is a contract address. For example, if it’s a DEX contract address, it means that the session key is only limited to calling an Artex contract.

- `Specific methods` is a list of method signature of `Specific contract`. For example, if it’s `[0x0000CAFE, 0xCAFE0000,]` , it means that the session key is only limited to this two method.

  

#### 2. Use session key to sign transaction

Additional info :

- The `from` is still the address of EoA.

- The signature `v,r,s` is generated by private key of sKey.

  

#### 3. Artela verify the transaction

Additional info

- The transaction may be signed by the EoA privaten point needs to be verified by the EoA public key again if the Aspect returns key, so the joi false.

  

#### 4. Call contract

Additional info

- Smart contract doesn’t know which keys sign the tx.

- When the smart contract accesses `msg.sender` , the value is `from` in the transaction.



### Implementation
Session-key Aspect project contains three components:

- **Client**, `sessioin-key-aspect.js`, a client for the dApp front end to use session key.
- **Aspect**, wasm bytecode deployed on Artela
- **Explorer,** extend Artela explorer to show Aspect info

#### What’s the difference between AA

**It works like AA (abstract account).** For example, we can design a kind of AA that can be signed by a main private key and some session keys.

**But it will be more flexible than AA.**

- EoA can not extend to AA.

  If you want to use session-key enable AA, you have to transfer your assets from your EoA to a new AA. This user experience might be terrible in some situations.

  By Session-Key Aspect, an EoA can send a transaction to bind it with Session-Key Aspect, and then the EoA will upgrade to a kind of AA that supports the session key. It needn’t transfer its assets.

- Users only need to manage one key.

  If you use AA, you might manage several AA wallets with different function. By using Aspect to extend EoA, you just use one wallet with several extension functions.


## Value to the Artela Ecosystem
The Session-Key Aspect brings several valuable features to the Artela Ecosystem:

**Enhanced Security:** By allowing EoAs to create session keys for specific transactions, the ecosystem becomes more secure as private keys are not exposed for every interaction.

**Improved Usability:** Users can enjoy a better user experience by managing one wallet with several extension functions, rather than dealing with multiple abstract accounts (AA).

**Flexibility:** EoAs can upgrade to a form of AA that supports session keys without the need to transfer assets, providing flexibility in managing accounts.

**Integration:** The Session-Key Aspect can be integrated into various dApps, enabling on-click trading for DeFi protocols, enhancing UX and wallet security for web applications, and making dApps function like web2 products with simplified login and interaction processes.
